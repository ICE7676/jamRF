# Flipper Zero RF Jammer

jamRF is a tool used to jam RF *it's in the name, duh* Sub-Ghz frequencies

## Regulations

You will not be able to start jamming if the selected frequency is not available to the Flipper. I recommend using a CFW that unlocks all frequencies before using.

## Usage

Select your frequency with the `<` and `>` buttons, then press `Ok` to start jamming.

> [!CAUTION]
> Jamming for a long time may damage the CC1101 inside of the Flipper, please use with caution.

> [!NOTE]
> The range of the flipper zero's built in antenna is ~20ft for low power jamming. Add an external CC1101 for more range, the app will automatically select it if it is properly configured within the firmware.

## Saftey

> [!WARNING]
> I cannot emphasize this enough, **Use this app responsibly**. Unauthorized RF jamming is illegal in the U.S. and may lead to fines or criminal charges.
